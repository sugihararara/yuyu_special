# Phase 1 Complete! 🎉

**Completed:** 2025-10-10

## What We Built

### ✅ Working Battle Flow System
A complete, end-to-end battle system that runs immediately!

**Files Created:**
- `src/logic/BattleFlow.ts` (417 lines) - Main battle orchestrator
- `src/logic/mocks/MockRNG.ts` - Random number generation
- `src/logic/mocks/MockTouki.ts` - Fighting spirit system
- `src/logic/mocks/MockBalance.ts` - Stamina/knockdown system
- `src/logic/mocks/MockCombat.ts` - Combat calculations
- `src/logic/mocks/MockDamage.ts` - Damage calculations

### ✅ Integration Test
**File:** `src/main.ts`

Test scenario runs automatically:
- **Battle:** Yusuke vs Kuwabara
- **3 Turns:** Different attacks (punch, defense, tech)
- **Results displayed** on canvas and in console

### 🎮 How to Test

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open: `http://localhost:3001` (or 3000)

**Steps:**
1. Open the main menu (root page)
2. Click **"Game UI Test (Debug Mode)"**
3. In the debug panel at the bottom, find the green **"🎮 BATTLE TEST"** section
4. Click **"▶ Run Battle Test (3 Turns)"** button
5. Watch the battle unfold!

You'll see:
- **Turn-by-turn updates** on the UI (1.5s delay between turns)
- **HP bars** decreasing
- **Touki meters** charging
- **Balance meters** filling
- **Reiki rewards** appearing in crystal ball
- **Messages** showing what happened
- **Console logs** with detailed battle info

### 📊 What Works Right Now

1. **Battle Flow** - 4 phases per turn:
   - Input (touki charging)
   - Preparation (frame timing - simplified)
   - Activation (execute actions)
   - Resolution (damage/effects)
   - Reward (crystal ball)

2. **Mock Systems** - Simple but functional:
   - RNG correction (fixed values)
   - Touki correction (linear scaling)
   - Balance correction (linear scaling)
   - Combat judgment (success vs evasion)
   - Damage calculation (with graze/direct hit)

3. **Game State Management**:
   - HP tracking
   - Balance tracking (knockdown at 256)
   - Touki charging
   - Reiki rewards
   - Initiative (先手/後手)
   - Win condition checking

### 🔧 Example Console Output

```
=== BATTLE FLOW TEST ===

Turn 1: P1 first | P1: →A (direct_hit) | P2: →A (graze)
  P1 HP: 96
  P2 HP: 91
  P1 Balance: 20
  P2 Balance: 40

Turn 2: P1 first | P1: →B (direct_hit) | P2: ↓A (evade)
  P1 HP: 96
  P2 HP: 86

Turn 3: P1 first | P1: ↑X (direct_hit) | P2: ↑X (graze)
  P1 HP: 96
  P2 HP: 81

=== FINAL STATE ===
Match Over: false
Winner: null
Total Turns: 3
```

## Why This Matters

### ✨ Immediate Feedback
You can **see battles work right now** - no waiting for full implementation!

### 🔄 Incremental Development
Each mock system can be replaced independently:
1. Replace MockRNG → test → works!
2. Replace MockTouki → test → works!
3. Replace MockBalance → test → works!
4. etc.

### 🧪 Continuous Testing
Every step of Phase 2 can be verified against the working baseline.

### 📐 Architecture Validation
Proves the separation of concerns:
- Battle Flow orchestrates
- Systems are pluggable
- Types are well-defined

## Next Steps: Phase 2

Replace mocks with real implementations, one by one:

1. **RNG System** (Phase 2.1)
   - Real random ranges (128-255, 192-255)
   - Different ranges for different scenarios

2. **Character Stats** (Phase 2.2)
   - Load real character data
   - Provide real move stats (4 core stats)

3. **Touki System** (Phase 2.3)
   - Use real lookup table (already exists!)
   - Real charge timing (61F/73F/96F/121F)

4. **Balance System** (Phase 2.4)
   - Use real lookup table (already exists!)
   - Real knockdown mechanics

5. **Combat Calculation** (Phase 2.5)
   - Full correction pipeline
   - Initiative penalties
   - Special modifiers (powered punch, clean hit)

6. **Damage Calculation** (Phase 2.6)
   - Real defense multipliers
   - Fractional damage
   - Simultaneous KO logic

## Development Strategy

```
Phase 1 ✅ → Working skeleton with mocks
         ↓
Phase 2 → Replace mocks with real systems
         ↓
Phase 3 → Add advanced systems (frames, reiki, rewards)
         ↓
Phase 4 → Integration & polish
```

Each phase builds on a **working foundation** - no "big bang" integration!

## Files Modified

- `src/main.ts` - Added battle test
- `STATUS.md` - Updated progress
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Marked Phase 1 complete
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Added mocks folder
- `README.md` - Added documentation links

## Validation Checklist

- ✅ Battle runs without errors
- ✅ HP decreases when hit
- ✅ Balance accumulates correctly
- ✅ Touki charges over time
- ✅ Initiative determined correctly
- ✅ Rewards distributed
- ✅ Win condition checked
- ✅ TypeScript compiles with no errors
- ✅ Dev server runs successfully

## Architecture Highlights

### Clean Separation
```typescript
BattleFlow
  ↓
Mock Systems (temporary)
  ↓
Types (permanent)
```

### Easy Replacement
```typescript
// Phase 1
private rng: MockRNG;

// Phase 2.1 (just change one line!)
private rng: RNGSystem;
```

### Comprehensive Types
- `BattleState` - Complete game state
- `BattleOutcome` - Turn results
- `PlayerTurnInput` - Input data
- `JudgmentResult` - Combat results
- All memory addresses documented!

**🎊 Congratulations! You now have a working Yu Yu Hakusho battle system!**

Next task: Start Phase 2.1 - Implement real RNG System
