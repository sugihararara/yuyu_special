# Spec Map Directory

## Purpose

This directory maps the relationship between:
- **UI Elements** (from `yuyuhakusho_ui_mockup.html`)
- **Game Specifications** (from `docs/spec_from_html/yuyuz_md/*.md`)

## What This Does

Acts as a reference guide:
- Find which documentation relates to each UI element
- Understand dependencies between systems
- Know what specs exist

## Structure

Each spec file describes one UI component or game system with:
- Related documentation files
- Dependencies
- Brief notes

**Note**: Implementation status is tracked separately in `status.md` to keep specs stable.
