Next: Phase 2.2 - Character Stats System (load real character data)

## Latest Milestone (2025-10-10) - Phase 2.1 Complete! 🎲

### Phase 2.1: RNG System (Just Completed!)
- ✅ Created RNGSystem.ts - Real random number generation
- ✅ Replaced MockRNG in BattleFlow
- ✅ Implements 4 RNG scenarios (both-attack, mixed, counter, aerial-collision)
- ✅ First player: 192-255/256 range (75%-100%)
- ✅ Second player: 192-255 or 128-255 depending on scenario
- ✅ Defensive disadvantage implemented (second player gets worse RNG in mixed scenarios)
- ✅ Tested with battle test - damage varies each turn!
- 🎮 **Battles are now unpredictable and realistic!**

### Phase 1 Complete! 🎉
- ✅ Created BattleFlow.ts - main battle orchestrator with 4-phase turn system
- ✅ Created 5 mock systems (MockRNG, MockTouki, MockBalance, MockCombat, MockDamage)
- ✅ Integrated mocks into BattleFlow with correction pipeline
- ✅ Built working test scenario (Yusuke vs Kuwabara, 3 turns)
- ✅ Battle runs end-to-end with damage, touki, balance calculations
- ✅ **Integrated with UI!** Interactive battle test button in game.html
- ✅ **Live UI updates!** HP, Touki, Balance, Reiki update in real-time
- ✅ **Touki animations!** Smooth 800ms charging animation before each turn
- ✅ **Touki reset!** Properly resets to 0 after each action (follows spec)
- ✅ **Initiative system!** Shows first/second player with input lamps
- 🎮 Click "Run Battle Test" button to see battles on the actual UI!
