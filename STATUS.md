## Current Focus
**Phase 2.6 Complete!** ✅ Damage Calculation implemented with real damage formulas!

Next: Phase 2.5 - Combat Calculation (full correction pipeline)

## Latest Milestone (2025-10-11) - Phase 2.6 Complete! 💥

### Phase 2.6: Damage Calculation System (Just Completed!)
- ✅ Created DamageCalculation.ts - Real damage formulas
- ✅ Replaced MockDamage in BattleFlow
- ✅ Full damage pipeline: Base × Touki × RNG × Balance × Defense × Hit type
- ✅ HP damage multipliers: Direct 100%, Graze 25%, Block 37.5%
- ✅ Balance damage multipliers: Direct 100%, Graze 50%
- ✅ Defense stats from character data (14.5% to 25.8% multipliers)
- ✅ Fractional damage accumulator system
- ✅ DoT (damage over time) effect support
- ✅ Double KO tiebreaker logic
- ✅ Special damage cases (graze to 0 HP, zero-damage moves)
- 💥 **Damage now calculates exactly like the original Super Famicom game!**

### Phase 2.4: Balance System
- ✅ Created BalanceSystem.ts - Real balance corrections
- ✅ Replaced MockBalance in BattleFlow
- ✅ Uses 256-level lookup table (0-255 balance values)
- ✅ Non-linear scaling: 0 balance = 100%, 255 balance = 68.4% performance (minimum)
- ✅ Knockdown detection (balance ≥ 256)
- ✅ Balance state tracking (normal/staggered/knockdown)
- ✅ Recovery frame calculation with button mashing
- ✅ Forced recovery detection
- ✅ Graze damage reduction (×1/2)
- ⚖️ **Balance now scales exactly like the original Super Famicom game!**

### Phase 2.3: Touki System
- ✅ Created ToukiSystem.ts - Real touki corrections
- ✅ Replaced MockTouki in BattleFlow
- ✅ Uses 97-level lookup table (0-96 touki values)
- ✅ Non-linear scaling: 30% touki = ~50% performance, 75% touki = ~90% performance
- ✅ Charge time calculation for all action types (punch/defense/technique/spirit)
- ✅ Touki UP/DOWN buff support
- ✅ Authentic scaling curve from original game
- 💪 **Touki now scales exactly like the original Super Famicom game!**

### Phase 2.2: Character Stats System
- ✅ Created CharacterStatsSystem.ts - Real character data loading
- ✅ Integrated with characterLoader.ts
- ✅ Loads real stats from JSON files (stats.json, moves.json, frames.json)
- ✅ Replaced MockCombat's hardcoded stats with real character moves
- ✅ Each character now has unique stats (Yusuke ≠ Kuwabara ≠ Hiei!)
- ✅ All 4 core stats per move (success, evasion, power, balance drain)
- ✅ Supports 3 characters: Yusuke, Kuwabara, Hiei
- ✅ Async loading before battle starts
- 🎮 **Characters now have real, authentic stats from the original game!**

### Phase 2.1: RNG System
- ✅ Created RNGSystem.ts - Real random number generation
- ✅ Replaced MockRNG in BattleFlow
- ✅ Implements 4 RNG scenarios (both-attack, mixed, counter, aerial-collision)
- ✅ First player: 192-255/256 range (75%-100%)
- ✅ Second player: 192-255 or 128-255 depending on scenario
- ✅ Defensive disadvantage implemented (second player gets worse RNG in mixed scenarios)
- ✅ Tested with battle test - damage varies each turn!
- 🎮 **Battles are now unpredictable and realistic!**

### Phase 1 Complete! 🎉
- ✅ Created BattleFlow.ts - main battle orchestrator with 4-phase turn system
- ✅ Created 5 mock systems (MockRNG, MockTouki, MockBalance, MockCombat, MockDamage)
- ✅ Integrated mocks into BattleFlow with correction pipeline
- ✅ Built working test scenario (Yusuke vs Kuwabara, 3 turns)
- ✅ Battle runs end-to-end with damage, touki, balance calculations
- ✅ **Integrated with UI!** Interactive battle test button in game.html
- ✅ **Live UI updates!** HP, Touki, Balance, Reiki update in real-time
- ✅ **Touki animations!** Smooth 800ms charging animation before each turn
- ✅ **Touki reset!** Properly resets to 0 after each action (follows spec)
- ✅ **Initiative system!** Shows first/second player with input lamps
- 🎮 Click "Run Battle Test" button to see battles on the actual UI!
